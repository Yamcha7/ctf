In this challenge, we have been given a source code
and an output.txt

We need to decrypt the output.txt 
So from the source code, we understand the FLAG or Message has been first encoded with base64 and then converted to hex 
We just need to reverse the whole process . 
One approach can be is to find tools online to decode the message from hex and then to base64 
However , I have used a program

This program was initially having some issues because of 0x at the start so we created output2 with the 0x removed . 
and when we execute the program we get the flag
