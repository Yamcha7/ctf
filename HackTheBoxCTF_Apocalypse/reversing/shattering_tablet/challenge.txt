In this challenge, we were told of a tablet that had been broken into several pieces and we need to join them back together to get the flag
We had been given the file tablet 
We first analyzed the file using radare
Radare gives us the option to view the code execution in a flow design format , which makes understanding the program flow little bit more easier

In this screenshot, we see a lot of if else blocks and the line cmp al, 0x5f is telling that characters are getting compared on basis of which if else is executed 

Now, I took a manual approach , I noted down every variable and their hex counterpart 
For ex, 
var-36h = 0x5f = _
var s = 0x48 = H
var 2ch = 0x65 = e

After the whole decryption , I got a string like this 
pTkd4e_Hr3_Br{br23vp13nb4n,3OttOr}r_3_

This told me i was close to the flag, but the tablet was still shattered 
I thought of using anagram solver but none could help .
Then radare gave me a pattern

In this order, i started setting the values from the variable (u really should try an automated approach)
and I got the flag !!!!!!!!!!!
